# Problem Statement
Converting between different world currencies can be confusing and error-prone when done manually. 
Users may not know the current rates or the right formula for conversion, 
which can lead to mistakes in financial calculations or travel planning. 
There is a need for a simple application to automate and simplify these conversions 
using reliable formulas.

# Scope of the Project
This project implements a basic, menu-driven currency converter that can
convert between Indian Rupees and three major currencies (USD, EURO, GBP) 
using fixed conversion rates. The application will run in the command-line/terminal
and allows the user to perform multiple conversions in a session, while ensuring user 
input is handled safely.

# Target Users
Students learning Python and basic programming concepts

Travellers and individuals needing quick, offline conversions between INR and common foreign currencies

Anyone looking for a basic, easy-to-use currency conversion tool without needing internet or complex software

# High-level Features
Menu-driven interface for currency pair selection

Convert USD ↔ INR, EURO ↔ INR, and GBP ↔ INR

Validates user input to prevent errors from negative or zero values

Rounds and displays converted results with two decimal places for clarity

Runs in a loop so multiple conversions can be done without restarting the program
