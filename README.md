# Currency Converter
# Overview of the Project:
This is a simple, menu-driven Currency Converter Calculator written in Python. It can convert amounts between Indian Rupees and three foreign currencies (USD, EURO, GBP) using fixed exchange rates. The program is easy to use for anyone learning about Python, conditionals, and functions. In this program we can convert currency with in second without any problem.
The application uses hardcoded, fixed exchange rates for all conversions and runs in a continuous loop, prompting the user for a choice until they select the option to exit the program.

# Features:
It Converts following rupees.

USD ↔ Rupee

EURO ↔ Rupee

GBP ↔ Rupee

Input validation to ignore zero and negative numbers

Easy-to-read results, rounded to two decimal places

Menu-driven interface with loop for multiple conversions in one run

# Technologies/Tools Used:
Python 3.x (Core language, no third-party libraries needed)

Any basic code editor or terminal

# Steps to Install & Run the Project:
Copy the Python code into a file named currency_converter.py.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed (python --version to check).

Open the terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder with your currency_converter.py file.

Run the program with:

text
python currency_converter.py
# Instructions for Testing:
Run the program and use the menu options (1–6) to convert between currencies.

Try several valid values.

Enter 0, negative numbers, or non-numeric values to check if errors are handled.

Choose a wrong menu number (like 9) to see if the program correctly states “invalid input”.

Repeat conversions using the loop to verify that the program continues working.
